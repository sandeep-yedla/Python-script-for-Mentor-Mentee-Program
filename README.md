#Description:
When I was serving as an Officer in Indian Students Association. We were constantly work with Indian students to make their arrival easy. 
We started a "Mentee-Mentor program to pair up an international student with an existing student to address their questions and concerns, academic and other. 

My task here was working on this program, collecting huge incoming data of the incoming students, analyse and matching them with students who voluntarily enrolled using course 
and need as a primary key to match.

#Action: 
•	Manual process, time taking and errors. Time sensitive and real time working was difficult. 
•	I Wanted to make it simpler by implementing my knowledge in python. 
•	Gathered ideas on how, wrote a code such that a mentor is matched against a mentee based on the course and automatically an email is just sent to both as an introduction. 
•	I capped the mentee number to two per mentor.
                
#Result:
•	This made the assignment easy and avoid errors
•	Helped in long term because this is done every year.
•	Appreciation from team because this not only made this work done quick but I could also help in other things.
•	Received positive feedback
•	Because of such an initiative and executing effectively I could help my team to help a lot of international students and got a recognition in the university

By developing this automated Python script ,I was able to ease the process for about thousands of incoming international students to The University of Texas at Dallas for which, 
I was recognized as a key contributor to the Golden Comet award our Organization received. 
This is a prestigious award presented to the best organization among 300 organizations
